# Stack-Based Virtual Machine (OS Project)

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a **Stack-Based Virtual Machine** implemented as part of my **Operating Systems course project**. The project focuses on understanding how a simple virtual machine works internally, including instruction execution, stack operations, and basic memory handling.

The implementation is **educational in nature** and was created by closely following a YouTube tutorial playlist by **Philip Bohun**. The main goal of this project was learning and experimentation rather than original research or commercial use.
